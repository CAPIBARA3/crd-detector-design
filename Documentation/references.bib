   abstract = {Cosmic rays are particles from outer space that travel across the universe. They can be made by the sun, by other stars exploding, and even black holes. They move extremely fast, nearly the speed of light, but when they hit the Earth they are generally blocked by our atmosphere and made harmless to humans.

    Scientists are fascinated by cosmic rays because they can tell us about space—where they came from and what they encountered along the way—as well as the makeup of the galaxy and the universe.

    The name “cosmic ray” dates back to 1925, when Nobel laureate and former UChicago faculty member Robert Millikan coined the term in a paper.},
